#+TITLE: dotfiles

* Goals
I have a few goals for this project. I want to oraganize my configuration files so I can share them across my machines, create a repeatable process for setting up my development environment, and generate my own personal FAQ surrounding tools and problems I run into for future reference.
* Dotfile organization
My dotfiles should be able to be cloned and symlinked to the home directory easily. This can either be via a tool like =stow= or my executing commands to create the symlink.
* Development Environment
This should be configured and maintained in the =Applications.org= file
* Tooling selection guidelines
I prefer to not use a mouse if I can help it, as such most of the tools I choose will probably have some for of =vim= emulation or keybindings. This is by no means a requirement but does enable me to have a consistent feel through my applications.
