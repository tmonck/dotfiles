#+TITLE: dotfiles

* Goals
This is an attempt to organize my dotfiles for sharing across multiple machines. This should allow me to have a consistent experience across different machines when I use the same application.

There will also be a repeatable process for setting up each type of machine I use. There should be scripts for machine setup generated from an org file.
